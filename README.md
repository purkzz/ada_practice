## Time Complexities
``` yml
TOH             --->O(2^n)
Binary Search   --->O(log n)
Linear Search   --->O(n)
Selection Sort  --->O(n^2)
Bubble Sort     --->O(n^2)
Inserion Sort   --->O(n^2)
```
### Ways to remember The algorithms

```yml 
selection sort  -->You first select the smallest number and then change the place of it
insertion sort  -->You first change the place and while putting it in the other postion you compare and put in the array
Binary Search   -->if(low>high)=>rtrn -1
```
